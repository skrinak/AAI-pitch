      "text": "Welcome, and thank you for your time. Today I'll walk you through Applied AI Investing - the platform that will democratise algorithmic trading for 50 million retail investors. Think of us as the YouTube of Algorithmic Trading - where creators share proven strategies and retail traders gain access to institutional-level AI. We're building the first community-driven marketplace for AI trading algorithms.",

    "problem": {
      "text": "Retail traders represent 20% of US stock volume in 2024, but they're severely underserved in AI trading tools. Pre-built trading bots cost £3,000-£10,000 annually with zero transparency into performance or methodology. Platforms like QuantConnect require PhD-level coding skills - completely inaccessible to average retail traders. There's no way to verify if algorithms actually work or if performance claims are legitimate.",

    },
    "solution": {
      "text": "Applied AI Investing introduces a community-driven Bring Your Own Algorithm model. Quant developers, data scientists, and AI experts upload their trading strategies to our platform. Real-time performance tracking, public leaderboards, and community validation ensure quality. Retail traders subscribe to proven strategies with full transparency and fair pricing. It's not just about tools - we're building an investing community where the best strategies rise to the top.",

    "market": {
      "text": "The US has approximately 50 million active brokerage accounts. Conservative estimate: 2-5% adoption rate for AI trading tools among retail investors. At just 1% adoption - 500,000 users - that's £170 million plus annual revenue at £20 per month average. At 3-5% adoption - 1.5 to 2.5 million users - we're looking at £600 million plus total addressable market in the US alone. EU and Asian markets could triple to quintuple our total addressable market.",

    "competition": {
      "text": "Direct competitors include QuantConnect, TradingView, and Collective2 - all have significant limitations. QuantConnect requires advanced coding skills and lacks retail-friendly interface. TradingView excels at charting, but has limited algorithm marketplace and execution. Collective2 focuses on copy trading, not transparent algorithm sharing. Our differentiator is the community-driven BYOA model with transparent validation and fair revenue sharing.",
      "duration": 22
    },
    "revenue": {
      "text": "We've modelled three realistic adoption scenarios with conservative pricing. 1% adoption generates £174 million Year 1, scaling to £361 million by Year 5. 3% adoption generates £522 million Year 1, reaching £1.08 billion by Year 5. 5% adoption generates £870 million Year 1, exceeding £1.8 billion by Year 5. Revenue streams include subscription tiers, revenue sharing, premium analytics, and institutional data licensing.",

    "moat": {
      "text": "Our moat is built on four interconnected pillars. Algorithm Database: proprietary collection of validated, performance-tracked trading strategies. Community Network: both creators and users create powerful network effects - more algorithms attract more users, more users attract more creators. Trust and Brand: transparent performance validation builds trust that's nearly impossible to replicate quickly. Broker Integrations: direct API partnerships with major platforms create switching costs and barriers to entry.",
      "duration": 23
    },
    "risks": {
      "text": "Regulatory risk: SEC and FINRA compliance is complex but manageable with proper legal framework. Performance risk: poor algorithm results could damage platform reputation. Competition risk: incumbents could replicate features. Mitigation strategies include engaging securities lawyers early, similar to how Robinhood navigated regulations. Clear performance disclaimers and risk education. First mover advantage: build community and network effects before competitors react.",
      "duration": 22

    "strategy": {
      "text": "Three-phase go-to-market strategy. Phase 1: Build Trust and Community with transparent performance leaderboards, strong education for non-technical users, and fair revenue sharing with 70-30 split to attract top creators. Phase 2: Subscription Model with free tier for limited access, standard at £20 per month for retail traders, and premium at £50 plus per month for advanced features. Phase 3: Scale and Integrate with broker API integrations, institutional tier launch for wealth managers, and global expansion starting with Canada and EU.",
