  "text": "The US has approximately 50 million active brokerage accounts. Conservative estimate: 2-5% adoption rate for AI trading tools among retail investors. At just 1% adoption - 500,000 users - that's $170 million plus annual revenue at $20 per month average. At 3-5% adoption - 1.5 to 2.5 million users - we're looking at $600 million plus total addressable market in the US alone. EU and Asian markets could triple to quintuple our total addressable market.",
