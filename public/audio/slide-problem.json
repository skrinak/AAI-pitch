  "text": "Retail traders represent 20% of US stock volume in 2024, but they're severely underserved in AI trading tools. Pre-built trading bots cost £3,000-£10,000 annually with zero transparency into performance or methodology. Platforms like QuantConnect require PhD-level coding skills - completely inaccessible to average retail traders. There's no way to verify if algorithms actually work or if performance claims are legitimate.",
